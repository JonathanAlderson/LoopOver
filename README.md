# LoopOver
Solver for the loopover game

https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/580366/

Made a python solver for this deterministic puzzle game.
It was fun to think about how to solve this problem 
efficiently. The solver can generate the sequence of moves
almost instantly and input them all within a second.

Most of the difficult comes with the Tesseract library
and correctly reading the letters on the screen.
Even when the letters are large and clear.
